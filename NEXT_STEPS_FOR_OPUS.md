## 🎯 Your Task

1. **Read the Documentation Files**
   - Review OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md thoroughly
   - Review IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md thoroughly
   - Understand what's already implemented vs. what's missing

2. **Analyze the Current State**
   - Review the current App.tsx
   - Check what components exist
   - Identify what's missing from the optimization plans

3. **Create a Priority List**
   - What critical features are still missing?
   - What quick wins can be implemented immediately?
   - What would provide the most value to users?

4. **Propose Implementation Plan**
   - Suggest what to implement next
   - Provide step-by-step approach
   - Estimate complexity and impact

## 🚨 Important Constraints

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Change existing component APIs without verifying they exist
- ❌ Use features from newer package versions than installed
- ❌ Break existing functionality
- ❌ Rewrite large sections from scratch
- ❌ Assume import paths - always verify

### DO:
- ✅ Read actual component files before modifying
- ✅ Make incremental changes
- ✅ Test after each change
- ✅ Follow the patterns already in the codebase
- ✅ Refer to CLAUDE_OPUS_GUIDE.md for lessons learned

## 🔍 What to Look For

When reviewing the documentation, please identify:

1. **Missing Critical Features** - What's hurting UX the most?
2. **Easy Wins** - What can be done quickly with high impact?
3. **Technical Debt** - What needs refactoring?
4. **Performance Issues** - What's causing slowdowns?
5. **API Compatibility** - Are all suggested features compatible with installed packages?

---

## 📊 Current Package Versions (Check These!)

Key dependencies from package.json:
- React Native: 0.79.5
- Expo: ~53.0.13
- React Native Reanimated: ~3.16.7
- React Native Gesture Handler: ~2.21.2
- React Native SVG: 15.11.2
- @shopify/react-native-skia: 1.7.6

**Always verify feature availability against these versions!**

## 💡 Suggested Approach

1. **First Pass**: Read all documentation files
2. **Second Pass**: Review current codebase (App.tsx, key components)
3. **Third Pass**: Create prioritized list of improvements
4. **Fourth Pass**: Propose implementation plan with code examples

For each proposed feature:
- ✅ Verify package compatibility
- ✅ Check if similar code exists
- ✅ Provide working code snippets
- ✅ Explain integration points
- ✅ Estimate impact and effort

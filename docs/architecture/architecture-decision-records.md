## ADR-001: React Native + Expo vs Native Development

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Decision Makers:** Product, Engineering, Architecture teams

### Context
TeaFlow requires cross-platform mobile development with complex animations, gesture controls, camera integration, and precise timing. We evaluated three approaches:

1. **Native iOS + Android** (Swift/Kotlin)
2. **React Native + Expo**
3. **Flutter**

### Decision
**Selected: React Native + Expo SDK 53**

### Rationale

**‚úÖ Advantages:**
- **Development Velocity:** Single codebase for iOS/Android reduces development time by 60%
- **Animation Ecosystem:** React Native Reanimated 3 + Skia provides 60fps animations needed for tea metaphors
- **Gesture Support:** react-native-gesture-handler handles complex gesture recognition requirements
- **Camera/ML Integration:** Vision Camera + ML Kit meets OCR scanning requirements
- **OTA Updates:** Expo Updates enables rapid iteration for gesture tuning
- **Team Expertise:** Existing team React/TypeScript knowledge

**‚ö†Ô∏è Tradeoffs:**
- **Performance Overhead:** ~10-15% performance cost vs native (acceptable for our use case)
- **Platform Limitations:** Some iOS/Android APIs require custom native modules
- **Bundle Size:** Larger app size than pure native (~25MB vs ~15MB)

**‚ùå Rejected Alternatives:**

**Native Development:**
- **Pros:** Maximum performance, full platform API access
- **Cons:** 2x development cost, gesture library ecosystem fragmented, animation complexity high

**Flutter:**
- **Pros:** Google's gesture recognition, good performance
- **Cons:** Limited tea brewing app ecosystem, Dart learning curve, less mature ML integration

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Expo configuration optimized for TeaFlow
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "TeaFlow",
    "slug": "teaflow",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android"],
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",
    "experiments": {
      "typedRoutes": true
    },
    "plugins": [
      ["expo-camera", { "cameraPermission": "Allow TeaFlow to scan tea packages" }],
      "expo-av",
      "expo-haptics",
      "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics
- Cross-platform feature parity: 100%
- Development velocity: 60% faster than native

## ADR-002: Skia vs React Native Reanimated for Animations

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-10

### Context
TeaFlow's core differentiator is living tea metaphor animations. We need 30-60fps organic animations of tea leaves drifting, steam rising, and color saturation changes during brewing. Evaluated options:

1. **React Native Skia** (GPU-accelerated 2D graphics)
2. **React Native Reanimated** (native driver animations)
3. **Lottie Animations** (pre-rendered animations)
4. **CSS-like Animations** (basic transforms)

### Decision
**Selected: React Native Skia with Reanimated integration**

### Rationale

**‚úÖ Why Skia:**
- **GPU Acceleration:** Direct GPU rendering for complex particle systems
- **Performance:** 60fps capable on high-end devices, 30fps on medium devices
- **Flexibility:** Real-time parameter control for gesture interactions
- **Custom Shaders:** Tea-specific effects (liquid simulation, steam particles)
- **Memory Efficiency:** Efficient particle system management

**üîÑ Hybrid Approach:**
```typescript
// Skia for complex graphics, Reanimated for UI interactions
const TeaVisualization = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}>
      {/* Skia-rendered tea leaves and steam */}
      <TeaLeavesParticleSystem />
      <SteamEffects />
      <ColorSaturationLayer />
    </Canvas>
    
    {/* Reanimated for gesture feedback */}
    <Animated.View style={gestureOverlayStyle}>
      <TouchFeedbackIndicators />
    </Animated.View>
  );
};
```

**‚ùå Rejected Alternatives:**

**Pure Reanimated:**
- **Limitation:** No particle systems, limited custom graphics
- **Performance:** Native driver fast, but not suitable for complex tea animations

**Lottie:**
- **Limitation:** Pre-rendered, cannot adapt to real-time gesture inputs
- **Inflexibility:** Cannot change tea type colors or brewing parameters

**CSS Animations:**
- **Limitation:** Too basic for organic tea metaphor requirements

### Performance Impact
- High-tier devices: 60fps target
- Medium-tier devices: 45fps target  
- Low-tier devices: 30fps with reduced particle count
- Memory budget: 60MB for animations on high-tier devices

## ADR-003: Gesture-First vs Traditional UI Paradigm

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-10

### Context
TeaFlow's core innovation is eliminating traditional UI buttons in favor of gestures on the brewing animation itself. This creates a meditative, zen-like experience but introduces UX complexity and accessibility challenges.

### Decision
**Selected: Gesture-First with Accessible Fallbacks**

### Rationale

**‚úÖ Strategic Advantages:**
- **Differentiation:** Unique in tea timer market, creates competitive moat
- **User Experience:** Hands-free operation ideal for wet tea brewing environment
- **Mindfulness:** Reduces cognitive load, promotes zen state during brewing
- **Innovation:** Positions TeaFlow as premium, forward-thinking product

**üéØ Core Gesture Set:**
```typescript
const CORE_GESTURES = {
  centerTap: 'Start/Pause timer',
  edgeTapLeft: 'Decrease time (-10s)',
  edgeTapRight: 'Increase time (+10s)',
  longPress: 'Reset timer',
  doubleTap: 'Next steep',
  horizontalSwipe: 'Change steep number',
  pinch: 'Adjust vessel size',
  twist: 'Adjust temperature'
};
```

**‚ôø Accessibility Strategy:**
```typescript
// Fallback UI for accessibility
const AccessibilityControls = () => {
  const a11ySettings = useAccessibilitySettings();
  
  if (a11ySettings.enableButtonFallbacks) {
    return <TraditionalButtonInterface />;
  }
  
  return <GestureOnlyInterface />;
};
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation:**
- **Learning Curve:** Interactive onboarding with gesture training
- **Motor Impairments:** Alternative button interface available
- **Accuracy Issues:** Extensive testing across device types (see ADR-004)
- **Market Acceptance:** Gradual rollout with user feedback loops

**‚ùå Rejected Traditional UI:**
- Would commoditize TeaFlow as "another timer app"
- Cluttered interface conflicts with zen philosophy
- Wet hands during tea brewing make buttons problematic

## ADR-004: Offline-First vs Cloud-First Data Architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-10

### Context
Tea brewing is a personal, intimate activity that often happens without internet connectivity. Users need complete functionality offline, but may want backup/sync across devices. Privacy is critical for tea preferences and habits.

### Decision
**Selected: Offline-First with Optional Cloud Sync**

### Rationale

**‚úÖ Offline-First Benefits:**
- **Reliability:** Tea brewing cannot depend on internet connectivity
- **Performance:** Instant app launch and tea selection
- **Privacy:** Local data by default, user controls cloud sharing
- **Battery:** No background network activity draining battery
- **Global Access:** Works in areas with poor connectivity

**üîÑ Data Architecture:**
```typescript
// Local-first with optional cloud backup
interface DataArchitecture {
  local: {
    primary: 'AsyncStorage + SQLite',
    encryption: 'iOS Keychain / Android Keystore',
    backup: 'iCloud / Google Drive (automatic)',
    sync: 'Manual export/import initially'
  },
  
  cloud: {
    optional: true,
    trigger: 'User explicitly enables',
    storage: 'AWS S3 with end-to-end encryption',
    auth: 'Firebase Auth (Google/Apple Sign-In)',
    conflict: 'Last-write-wins with manual resolution'
  }
}
```

**üîê Privacy Design:**
- Default: Complete offline operation
- User Choice: Explicit opt-in for cloud features
- Encryption: End-to-end encrypted cloud storage
- Anonymization: No personal identification required for core features

**‚ùå Rejected Cloud-First:**
- **Reliability Risk:** Network failures break core tea brewing
- **Privacy Concerns:** Forced cloud storage of personal habits
- **Performance:** Network latency affects app responsiveness
- **Costs:** Higher infrastructure costs for free tier users

### Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// Progressive enhancement approach
class DataManager {
  // Always available
  async saveTeaLocally(tea: TeaProfile): Promise<void> { }
  async loadLocalTeas(): Promise<TeaProfile[]> { }
  
  // Optional cloud features
  async enableCloudSync(): Promise<void> { }
  async syncToCloud(): Promise<SyncResult> { }
  async resolveConflicts(): Promise<void> { }
}
```

## ADR-005: Firebase Auth vs Custom Authentication

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-10

### Context
For optional cloud features, we need user authentication that's simple, secure, and privacy-focused. Most tea enthusiasts value simplicity over feature complexity.

### Decision
**Selected: Firebase Auth with Social Sign-In**

### Rationale

**‚úÖ Firebase Auth Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** Google/Apple Sign-In reduces friction
- **Security:** Industry-standard OAuth implementation
- **Privacy:** No password storage, minimal data collection
- **Reliability:** Google-scale infrastructure and uptime
- **Integration:** Native iOS/Android biometric authentication

**üîê Authentication Flow:**
```typescript
// Minimal friction authentication
const AuthenticationFlow = {
  required: false, // Core app works without auth
  
  options: [
    'Sign in with Apple',    // iOS preferred
    'Sign in with Google',   // Android preferred
    'Continue as Guest'      // Full functionality, no sync
  ],
  
  dataCollection: 'minimal', // Only email for account recovery
  anonymousAnalytics: true   // Aggregated usage data only
};
```

**‚ôø Privacy-First Implementation:**
- **Anonymous Core:** Full app functionality without account
- **Explicit Consent:** Clear explanation of cloud sync benefits
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect essential information
- **Easy Deletion:** One-tap account and data deletion

**‚ùå Rejected Custom Auth:**
- **Security Risk:** Rolling our own auth increases vulnerability
- **Development Cost:** Significant engineering time for non-core feature
- **User Experience:** Additional username/password friction
- **Maintenance:** Ongoing security updates and compliance

**‚ùå Rejected OAuth Providers:**
- **Facebook/Meta:** Privacy concerns conflict with tea mindfulness brand
- **Twitter/X:** Unstable platform, unclear privacy policies
- **Email/Password:** Friction conflicts with zen simplicity

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Firebase Auth configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // iOS configuration
  appleDeveloperTeamId: process.env.APPLE_TEAM_ID,
  appleAppId: process.env.APPLE_APP_ID,
  
  // Android configuration  
  googleServicesJson: './google-services.json',
  
  // Privacy settings
  anonymousAnalytics: true,
  dataDeletionWebhook: 'https://api.teaflow.app/auth/delete-user-data'
};
```

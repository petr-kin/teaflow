# Complete Video-Based Interface System (MISSING FROM VISUAL MOCKUPS!)

**Responsibility:** Full video-based interface system replacing traditional 3D graphics with zen tea brewing videos and seamless UI overlays

**Video System Architecture:**
```typescript
interface VideoBasedInterfaceSystem {
  // Timer screen video background system
  timerScreenVideo: {
    backgroundVideo: {
      content: "Full-screen tea brewing video with gentle steam animation";
      videoSpecs: "MP4 H.264, 1080x1920 vertical mobile, 10-15 second seamless loops";
      categories: {
        greenTea: "Light amber liquid, gentle movement, delicate steam";
        blackTea: "Dark amber liquid, robust steeping, dense steam"; 
        oolong: "Medium amber, swirling patterns, moderate steam";
        puerh: "Deep reddish brewing, rich steeping, heavy steam";
        whiteTea: "Very light liquid, delicate steeping, minimal steam";
        herbal: "Various colors, floral movements, aromatic steam";
      };
    };
    
    overlaySystem: {
      semiTransparentUI: "Semi-transparent overlays over video for text readability";
      floatingTeaCard: "Tea name + temperature/volume info at top";
      circularTimer: "MM:SS format with progress ring in center";
      actionButtons: "Play/Pause + Next Steep floating at bottom";
      gestureHints: "Minimal text at very bottom for user guidance";
    };
    
    gestureVideoIntegration: {
      verticalSwipe: "Temperature control ±5°C with overlay thermometer + steam intensity change";
      horizontalSwipe: "Volume control ±10ml with overlay vessel size + visual scaling";
      longPress: "Tea information overlay appears over dimmed video";
      doubleTap: "Restart current steep with video flash effect";
    };
  };
  
  // Tea library video thumbnail system
  teaLibraryVideoSystem: {
    videoThumbnails: {
      staticPreview: "Shows tea color at peak steeping as thumbnail";
      hoverMicroAnimation: "Tap triggers 2-second mini preview loop";
      teaTypeVisualCoding: "Different video styles per tea category for instant recognition";
    };
    
    ocrVideoIntegration: {
      captureToVideo: "OCR package capture → Generate custom video thumbnail preview";
      previewGeneration: "Show what video will look like before creating tea profile";
      customVideoCreation: "Generate personalized brewing video based on tea parameters";
    };
    
    libraryInterface: {
      searchOverVideo: "Search functionality with video thumbnails in grid";
      filterTabs: "All, Green, Black, Oolong filter tabs with video previews";

    };
  };
  
  // Video performance optimization
  videoPerformanceSystem: {
    hardwareAcceleration: "Enabled for smooth 30fps playback on mid-range devices";
    adaptiveQuality: "Multiple quality levels based on device capabilities";
    preloadingStrategy: "Next video in sequence preloaded for seamless transitions";
    cacheManagement: "Smart caching of favorite tea videos with memory limits";
    batteryOptimization: "Reduce video quality in power save mode, pause when backgrounded";
  };
  
  // Video state synchronization
  videoStateSynchronization: {
    preparation: "Empty vessel, tea leaves ready - gentle ambient movement";
    activeBrewing: "Tea steeping, color developing - video progress matches timer progress";
    complete: "Perfect tea color achieved - 3-5 second glow/celebration animation";
    betweenSteeps: "Gentle steam, peaceful waiting state until next steep starts";
  };
}

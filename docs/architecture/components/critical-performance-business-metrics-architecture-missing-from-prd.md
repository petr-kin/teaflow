# Critical Performance & Business Metrics Architecture (MISSING FROM PRD!)

**Responsibility:** Systematic tracking and validation of critical performance targets and business success metrics

**Performance Metrics Architecture:**
```typescript
interface CriticalPerformanceTargetsSystem {
  // Core functionality performance requirements
  technicalPerformance: {
    timerAccuracy: {
      target: "≤0.2s per minute drift cross-platform";
      measurement: "Measured across 10+ device types";
      criticality: "CRITICAL - affects user trust in core functionality";
      implementation: "High-precision intervals with drift compensation, system time cross-reference";
    };
    
    animationPerformance: {
      target: "30fps sustained during 3-minute brewing sessions";
      measurement: "Frame rate monitoring during active timer";
      criticality: "HIGH - maintains zen experience quality";
      implementation: "Hardware acceleration, adaptive quality, native driver animations";

    gestureAccuracy: {
      target: ">95% recognition rate";
      measurement: "<2% false positives in user testing";
      criticality: "CRITICAL - core interaction paradigm depends on this";
      implementation: "Sophisticated gesture conflict resolution, zone-based detection";
    };
    
    batteryOptimization: {
      target: "<2% battery drain per brewing session";
      measurement: "Battery usage during 3-minute timer sessions";
      criticality: "HIGH - affects user retention and satisfaction";
      implementation: "Pause animations when backgrounded, efficient video rendering";
    };
    
    memoryManagement: {
      target: "<100MB active memory, no accumulation";
      measurement: "Memory profiling during extended usage";
      criticality: "MEDIUM - prevents app crashes and slowdowns";

    };
  };

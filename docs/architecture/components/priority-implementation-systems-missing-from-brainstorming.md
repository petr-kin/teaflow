# Priority Implementation Systems (MISSING FROM BRAINSTORMING!)

**Responsibility:** Top-priority systems from brainstorming that need immediate architectural support

**Priority #1: Gesture-Based Timer Core:**
```typescript
interface GestureBasedTimerCore {
  description: "Replace buttons with tap/edge-tap/long-press gestures on hourglass animation";
  
  implementation: {
    gestures: "edge-tap (±5s), center-tap (start/pause), long-press (reset)";
    visualFeedback: "Haptic + visual confirmation for each gesture";
    technology: "React Native Gesture Handler + hourglass video assets + timer logic";
    foundation: "Essential foundation for entire app experience";
  };
  
  timeline: "2-3 weeks for MVP functionality";
  
  successCriteria: {
    enablesGoal: "≤2 taps to start brewing from app launch";
    userExperience: "Intuitive gesture discovery without tutorial";
    technicalTarget: ">95% gesture recognition accuracy";
  };
  
  resources: {
    gestureHandlers: "React Native Gesture Handler library";
    videoAssets: "Hourglass animation videos for different tea types";
    timerLogic: "High-precision timer with drift compensation";
    hapticFeedback: "Expo Haptics for gesture confirmation";
  };
}
```

**Priority #2: Smart Quick Access System:**
```typescript
interface SmartQuickAccessSystem {
  description: "App opens directly to last used tea with vessel/temp settings ready";
  
  implementation: {
    lastTeaPersistence: "AsyncStorage for last selected tea profile";
    vesselMemory: "Remember user's preferred vessel size per tea";
    temperatureMemory: "Remember user's temperature adjustments";
    oneTabBrewing: "Single tap starts brewing with remembered settings";
  };
  
  timeline: "1-2 weeks alongside timer core";
  
  successCriteria: {
    coreGoal: "Directly supports ≤2 taps requirement and fast start";
    userJourney: "Returning users bypass tea selection step";
    stateManagement: "Seamless app restoration from background";
  };
  
  technology: {
    storage: "AsyncStorage implementation for preferences";
    stateManagement: "Context/Zustand for current session state";
    backgroundState: "Proper timer state preservation during app backgrounding";
  };
}
```

**Dual-Purpose Design Philosophy:**
```typescript
interface DualPurposeDesignSystem {
  // Core principle from brainstorming: every element serves aesthetic + functional roles
  principle: "Eliminate interface clutter while maximizing functionality through dual-purpose elements";
  
  examples: {
    hourglassGestural: "Hourglass animation serves as both visual metaphor AND gesture control surface";
    backgroundsAsState: "Video backgrounds indicate brewing phase and tea type simultaneously";
    feedbackAsProfile: "User feedback during brewing builds tea preference profile";
    visualFirstInterface: "Replace traditional controls with gesture-responsive visual elements";
  };
  
  implementation: {
    gestureAreas: "Invisible touch zones over beautiful animations";
    stateVisualization: "Animation intensity/color reflects brewing progress";
    contextualFeedback: "Visual responses that enhance rather than distract from zen experience";
    multimodalCues: "Combine visual, haptic, and audio feedback seamlessly";
  };
  
  goals: {
    beautyAndFunction: "Beauty and function merge rather than compete";
    zenSimplicity: "Less interface, more experience";
    contextAwareness: "Smart defaults based on usage patterns reduce friction";
  };
}
```

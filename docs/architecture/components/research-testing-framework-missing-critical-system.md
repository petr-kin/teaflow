# Research & Testing Framework (MISSING CRITICAL SYSTEM!)

**Responsibility:** Systematic validation of critical architecture decisions through structured research and testing phases

**Implementation Research Pipeline:**
```typescript
interface ImplementationResearchFramework {
  week1_2_CriticalResearch: {
    timerAccuracyTesting: {
      goal: "Test background timer drift across devices";
      method: "React Native timer accuracy measurement";
      successCriteria: "<0.2s/min drift across 10+ device types";
      blockerRisk: "High - affects user trust in core functionality";
    };
    
    gestureLibraryEvaluation: {
      goal: "Compare gesture handler options for conflict resolution";
      method: "React Native Gesture Handler vs alternatives";
      successCriteria: "<2% false positives in user testing";
      blockerRisk: "High - core interaction paradigm";
    };
    
    ocrLibraryAssessment: {
      goal: "Test ML Kit vs Tesseract vs cloud OCR for tea packages";
      method: "Accuracy testing on variety of tea packages";
      successCriteria: ">80% extraction rate on clear packages";
      blockerRisk: "Medium - fallback to manual entry available";
    };
    
    storageArchitecture: {
      goal: "Decide local-only vs cloud-sync architecture";
      method: "Privacy/performance tradeoff analysis";
      successCriteria: "Clear user acceptance of chosen approach";
      blockerRisk: "High - affects entire data architecture";
    };
  };
  
  week3_4_PrototypeTesting: {
    gesturePrototype: "Test tap/edge-tap/long-press recognition accuracy";
    timerReliability: "Extended testing across iOS/Android for consistency";
    ocrProofOfConcept: "Test parsing accuracy on variety of tea packages";
    accessibilityTesting: "Interview users with motor/visual impairments";
  };
  
  month2_UserValidation: {
    zenUXTesting: "Measure user calm/frustration with gesture-only interface";
    onboardingFlow: "Test how quickly users learn gesture system";
    learningAcceptance: "Validate adaptive suggestions feel helpful vs intrusive";
    culturalResonance: "Test visual design across different tea traditions";
  };
}
```

**Validation Metrics Architecture:**
```typescript
interface ValidationMetricsSystem {
  technicalMetrics: {
    timerDrift: {
      target: "<0.2s/min";
      measurement: "across 10+ device types";
      criticality: "BLOCKER - affects user trust";
    };
    gestureAccuracy: {
      target: "<2% false positives"; 
      measurement: "in user testing";
      criticality: "BLOCKER - core interaction";
    };
    ocrSuccess: {
      target: ">80% extraction rate";
      measurement: "on clear packages";
      criticality: "HIGH - affects onboarding";
    };
  };
  
  uxMetrics: {
    zenExperience: {
      target: "Users report feeling calmer, not stressed";
      measurement: "post-session surveys";
      criticality: "HIGH - core value proposition";
    };
    learningAcceptance: {
      target: ">70% users find suggestions helpful";
      measurement: "feedback surveys";
      criticality: "MEDIUM - premium feature";
    };
    accessibility: {
      target: "Alternative interactions work for impaired users";
      measurement: "accessibility user testing";
      criticality: "HIGH - app store compliance";
    };
  };
}
```

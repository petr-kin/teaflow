# Introduction

This document outlines the complete CI/CD pipeline architecture for **TeaFlow**, including deployment automation, environment configuration management, and production deployment strategies. It serves as the architectural foundation for DevOps automation, ensuring reliable, secure, and efficient deployment pipelines across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines infrastructure automation, deployment orchestration, and environment management into a cohesive CI/CD strategy that supports modern fullstack development workflows.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Project Analysis:**
- **Current Status:** TeaFlow appears to be a React Native/Expo application based on the git status showing `App.tsx`, `app.json`, and component files
- **Platform:** Mobile-first application with React Native components
- **Build System:** Likely Expo/React Native CLI based
- **Current State:** Active development with multiple modified files and new components

**Project Foundation (TeaFlow):**

**Codebase Status:**
- Framework: React Native (0.79.x) + Expo SDK 53 (managed workflow)
- Core Entry: App.tsx and app.json confirm Expo structure
- Components: Custom graphics (tea leaves, kettle, hourglass) + advanced gesture/timer logic
- Docs & PRDs: Multiple enhancement specs in /docs, confirming structured product roadmap

**Platform Target:**
- Mobile-first: iOS + Android as primary delivery
- Web potential: Expo supports web builds (expo start:web) â€” could be used for marketing/demo, but not a core requirement yet

**Build & Deployment:**
- Expo Managed Workflow
- Build system: EAS Build (Expo Application Services) is the expected path for production apps
- Signing: Managed with Expo credentials system (or manually with Apple Developer / Google Play keys if needed)
- OTA updates: Expo Updates can push minor changes without full app store redeploy
- iOS deployment: Requires Apple Developer account, provisioning profiles, app signing
- Android deployment: Requires Google Play Console, keystore management

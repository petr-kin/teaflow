# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Pipeline Security:**
- **Secret Management:** All credentials stored in GitHub Secrets with environment-specific access controls
- **Build Isolation:** Each build runs in isolated containers with minimal permissions
- **Code Signing:** Automated certificate management through EAS with hardware security module backing
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** CodeQL analysis on every pull request with automatic security alerts

**Mobile App Security:**
- **API Communication:** TLS 1.3 encryption for all network requests with certificate pinning
- **Data Storage:** Encrypted local storage using Expo SecureStore for sensitive user data
- **Authentication:** Biometric authentication with secure token storage and automatic rotation
- **Runtime Protection:** Obfuscated production builds with anti-tampering measures

**CI/CD Security:**
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions with least-privilege principle for GitHub Actions
- **Audit Logging:** Complete audit trail of all deployment activities and secret access
- **Network Security:** VPC isolation for build environments with restricted egress rules
- **Supply Chain:** Dependency scanning with automated vulnerability patches via Dependabot

## Performance Optimization

**Pipeline Performance:**
- **Build Time Target:** < 8 minutes for iOS builds, < 6 minutes for Android builds
- **Caching Strategy:** Aggressive caching of dependencies, build outputs, and test results
- **Parallel Execution:** Concurrent iOS/Android builds with optimized resource allocation
- **Incremental Builds:** Smart build detection to skip unchanged components

**Mobile App Performance:**
- **Bundle Size Target:** < 50MB total app size with < 20MB JavaScript bundle
- **Loading Strategy:** Code splitting with lazy loading for non-critical screens
- **Animation Performance:** 60fps target with hardware acceleration for all UI animations
- **Memory Management:** < 150MB RAM usage during normal operation

**API Performance:**
- **Response Time Target:** < 200ms for 95th percentile API responses
- **Caching Strategy:** CDN caching for static assets with edge distribution
- **Rate Limiting:** Adaptive rate limiting to prevent abuse while maintaining UX

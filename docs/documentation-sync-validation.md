**Verified Consistent Versions:**
```json
{
  "react-native": "0.79.5",
  "expo": "~53.0.0", 
  "react-native-reanimated": "~3.15.0",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.19.0",
  "react-native-skia": "@shopify/react-native-skia@2.2.6",
  "expo-av": "~15.0.1",
  "typescript": "5.0+",
  "node": "18+ LTS"
}
```

## Cross-Reference Validation

### **Epic Dependencies** ✅

**Validated Dependency Chain:**
```mermaid
Epic 1.1 (Core Timer) → Epic 1.2 (Animations) → Epic 1.3 (Learning)
                     ↓
Epic 1.4 (Zen Optimization) ← Epic 1.5 (Infrastructure)
                     ↓
Epic 1.6 (Data Management) → Epic 1.7 (Community Foundation)
                     ↓
[POST-MVP] Epic 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
```

- ✅ Weather integration marked as Epic 2 (POST-MVP)
- ✅ Cultural validation framework referenced in all relevant epics

**Deployment References:**
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline matches development-plan.md timelines
- ✅ Environment configurations align with tech-stack.md
- ✅ Cultural expert API setup properly integrated
- ✅ Monitoring strategy matches performance requirements

### **Cultural Authenticity References** ✅

**Cultural Framework Consistency:**

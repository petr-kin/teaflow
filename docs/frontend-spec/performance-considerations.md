# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **App Launch:** <2 seconds to first interactive frame
- **Screen Transitions:** <400ms with video backgrounds active
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps during all interactions
- **Battery Impact:** Optimize video loops for minimal battery drain

## Design Strategies
**Video Optimization:** Use hardware-accelerated formats, adaptive quality based on device capability
**Animation Layering:** Separate animation layers to reduce rendering complexity
**Lazy Loading:** Load tea library images and videos on demand
**Memory Management:** Intelligent caching for frequently accessed teas and videos
**Background Processing:** Minimize CPU usage during active brewing sessions

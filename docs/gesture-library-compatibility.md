#!/bin/bash
# monitor-gesture-compatibility.sh

echo "🤏 Monitoring gesture library compatibility..."

# Check for breaking changes in dependencies
npm outdated react-native-reanimated
npm outdated react-native-gesture-handler
npm outdated @shopify/react-native-skia

# Automated compatibility testing
npm run test:gesture-compatibility

# Performance regression testing
npm run test:gesture-performance

# Cross-platform consistency testing
npm run test:gesture-cross-platform

echo "✅ Gesture compatibility monitoring complete"
```

  test('Reanimated 3.15.0 with Gesture Handler 2.19.0', async () => {
    const gestureResponse = await simulateGesture('tap', { x: 100, y: 100 });
    const animationResponse = await triggerAnimation('fadeIn');
    
    expect(gestureResponse.latency).toBeLessThan(100);
    expect(animationResponse.fps).toBeGreaterThan(30);
    expect(gestureResponse.accuracy).toBeGreaterThan(0.95);
  });
  
  test('Skia 2.2.6 animation performance', async () => {
    const teaAnimation = await renderTeaMetaphor({
      complexity: 'medium',
      duration: 5000,
      particles: 50
    });
    
    expect(teaAnimation.averageFPS).toBeGreaterThan(30);
    expect(teaAnimation.memoryUsage).toBeLessThan(100); // MB
    expect(teaAnimation.droppedFrames).toBeLessThan(5);
  });
  
  test('Video + Gesture overlay compatibility', async () => {
    const videoPlayer = await startVideoBackground('tea-brewing-loop.mp4');
    const gestureOverlay = await enableGestureOverlay();
    
    expect(videoPlayer.performance.fps).toBeGreaterThan(29);
    expect(gestureOverlay.touchResponse).toBeLessThan(100); // ms
    expect(videoPlayer.memoryUsage + gestureOverlay.memoryUsage).toBeLessThan(200); // MB
  });
});
```

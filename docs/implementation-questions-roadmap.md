# TeaFlow Implementation Questions Roadmap

**Generated:** 2025-09-10  
**Source:** Question Storming Session  
**Purpose:** Critical questions requiring research/decisions before implementation

## Question Priority Matrix

### üö® CRITICAL - Must Answer Before Coding
*These questions could block or derail entire implementation*

#### Timer & Technical Foundation
- **Timer accuracy architecture:** How to guarantee ‚â§0.2s/min drift cross-platform?
- **Cross-platform timing sync:** How to ensure timer + haptic/audio cues remain consistent across iOS vs. Android?
- **Background state management:** If user backgrounds app mid-gesture, does timer state remain consistent?

#### Core UX Decisions  
- **Gesture conflict resolution:** How to prevent overlap between gestures (swipe vs. tap, pinch vs. swirl)?
- **Accessibility fallback:** What fallback for users with motor impairments? Safe numeric mode needed?
- **Privacy/storage architecture:** Local storage only or cloud sync? How to protect consumption habits?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY - Need Answers Early in Development
*These will significantly impact architecture and early user experience*

#### Learning System Design
- **Feedback weighting algorithm:** How to balance single-session feedback vs. long-term trends?
- **Conflicting feedback resolution:** How to handle contradictory user signals for same tea?
- **Cold start problem:** How to make reliable suggestions for new teas with no personal data?
- **Learning transparency:** How much visibility should users have into adaptation system?

#### OCR Implementation
- **Quality threshold:** What minimum OCR accuracy makes users trust vs. manually enter?
- **Photo requirements:** What resolution/lighting needed for reliable package text extraction?
- **Parsing intelligence:** How to differentiate marketing copy from brewing parameters?
- **Offline processing:** Can OCR function without internet, or queue for cloud parsing?

### üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY - Address During Feature Development
*Important for feature quality, but won't block initial implementation*

#### Performance & Scalability
- **Battery optimization:** How to prevent background timers/haptics from draining battery?
- **Memory management:** Upper limit on session history/images before performance degrades?
- **Animation performance:** How many gesture listeners + animations can run at 60fps?
- **Future-proof architecture:** How to structure code to avoid technical debt for stretch features?

#### Advanced UX
- **Undo/confirmation:** Should accidental gesture changes be instantly applied or offer undo?
- **Onboarding design:** How to teach gesture system without cluttering zen interface?
- **Cultural design variants:** Do zen visuals resonate across different tea cultures?
- **Aesthetic vs. performance:** Graceful degradation plan for beautiful animations on weak devices?

### üéØ STRATEGIC - Long-term Planning
*Important for product direction, but not immediate implementation blockers*

#### Business Model
- **Revenue alignment:** Free app (zen ethos) vs. premium features (cloud sync, integrations)?
- **Market differentiation:** How to position as more than another timer app?
- **Community vs. minimal:** Should TeaFlow become tea hub or stay personal/minimal?
- **Growth channels:** Most authentic user acquisition approach?

#### Data & Collections
- **Multilingual OCR:** How to handle Chinese/Japanese/Korean text alongside English?
- **Data consistency:** How to handle multiple scans of same tea (different boxes/years)?
- **Offline resilience:** Can entire adaptive engine run without cloud dependencies?

#### User Engagement
- **Retention strategies:** What keeps users engaged after hourglass novelty wears off?
- **Success metrics:** How to measure TeaFlow success - DAU, sessions, retention?
- **User testing validation:** How to measure "calm" vs. "confusing" in UX research?

## Research & Decision Framework

### Immediate Research Needed (Week 1-2)
1. **React Native timer accuracy**: Test background timer drift across devices
2. **Gesture library evaluation**: Compare React Native gesture handler options for conflict resolution
3. **OCR library assessment**: Test ML Kit vs. Tesseract vs. cloud OCR for tea packaging
4. **Storage architecture**: Local-only vs. cloud-sync privacy/performance tradeoffs

### Prototype & Test (Week 3-4)  
1. **Basic gesture prototype**: Test tap/edge-tap/long-press recognition accuracy
2. **Timer reliability**: Extended testing across iOS/Android for consistency
3. **OCR proof-of-concept**: Test parsing accuracy on variety of tea packages
4. **Accessibility testing**: Interview users with motor/visual impairments

### User Validation (Month 2)
1. **Zen UX testing**: Measure user calm/frustration with gesture-only interface
2. **Onboarding flow**: Test how quickly users learn gesture system
3. **Learning system acceptance**: Validate that adaptive suggestions feel helpful vs. intrusive
4. **Cultural resonance**: Test visual design across different tea brewing traditions

### Business Validation (Month 3+)
1. **Market positioning research**: Competitive analysis of timer/tea apps
2. **Revenue model testing**: User willingness to pay for premium features
3. **Community interest**: Gauge user desire for social/sharing features
4. **Retention analysis**: Which features correlate with long-term usage

## Decision Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies (Must resolve first)
- **Timer architecture** ‚Üí impacts all other timing features
- **Privacy/storage model** ‚Üí affects learning system design
- **Accessibility approach** ‚Üí influences entire gesture system design

### Sequential Dependencies  
- **OCR quality standards** ‚Üí determines collection workflow design
- **Learning system approach** ‚Üí affects suggestion UI patterns
- **Revenue model** ‚Üí impacts feature prioritization and development timeline

### Parallel Research Streams
- **Performance optimization** (can research alongside core development)
- **Cultural design variants** (can develop after core UX proven)
- **Community features** (separate from core personal experience)

## Success Criteria for Each Question Category

### Technical Questions - Success = Measurable Performance
- Timer drift: <0.2s/min measured across 10+ device types
- Gesture accuracy: <2% false positives in user testing
- OCR success: >80% extraction rate on clear packages

### UX Questions - Success = User Behavior Validation  
- Zen experience: Users report feeling calmer, not more stressed
- Learning acceptance: >70% users find suggestions helpful
- Accessibility: Alternative interactions work for impaired users

### Business Questions - Success = Market Validation
- Differentiation: Users choose TeaFlow over other timer apps
- Retention: >50% users still active after 30 days
- Revenue: Sustainable growth path identified

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize critical questions** from top section for immediate research
2. **Assign research methods** to each question category
3. **Create testing timeline** aligned with development phases
4. **Establish decision deadlines** for each blocking question
5. **Set up validation metrics** for measuring success

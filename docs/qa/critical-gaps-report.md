# QA Critical Gaps Report - TeaFlow App

## Executive Summary
**Status: CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED** üî¥  
Current implementation has basic functionality but completely misses the premium UX vision from PRD.

## Core Functionality Assessment

### ‚úÖ WORKING (Basic Level)
- Timer countdown with gesture controls
- Tea selection and navigation  
- Start/Pause/Reset functionality
- Vessel and temperature adjustment
- Recent steeps tracking
- Basic theme system

### ‚ùå MAJOR GAPS VS PRD REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Visual Design (Critical Gap)
**PRD Requirement**: Tea-inspired color palette, organic motion, minimalist aesthetic  
**Current State**: Generic green/grey interface, no visual polish  
**Impact**: Product looks amateur, not premium as specified

#### 2. Missing Core UX Features
**PRD Requirement**: Gesture canvas as main interaction  
**Current State**: Basic button interface  
**Missing**: 
- Swipe-based navigation
- Physics-based animations
- Organic motion design
- Visual feedback system

#### 3. Broken Components  
**PRD Requirement**: Tea brewing visualization
**Current State**: VideoTeaVisualization component crashes app
**Impact**: Core visual feature completely non-functional

#### 4. Information Architecture Gap
**PRD Requirement**: "Last Tea Ready" default view, swipe down for tea grid
**Current State**: Standard mobile app navigation pattern
**Gap**: Entire interaction model is wrong

## Immediate Action Required

### Priority 1: Fix Visual Design
- Implement tea-inspired color system from PRD section 4.2
- Add organic animations and micro-interactions  
- Apply minimalist design principles

### Priority 2: Fix Core UX
- Implement gesture-first navigation
- Add physics-based animations
- Create proper information architecture

### Priority 3: Fix Broken Features
- Replace or fix VideoTeaVisualization 
- Restore background wave animations
- Add proper visual feedback

## Recommendation
**DO NOT SHIP** current version. Basic functionality works but product doesn't match design vision and will fail in market due to poor UX compared to PRD specifications.

Need design implementation sprint to bring code up to PRD standards.

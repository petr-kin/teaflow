**Epic ID:** EPIC-1.6  
**Phase:** 6 - Data Lifecycle Management (Month 3)  
**Priority:** P1 (Essential for Multi-Device Experience)  
**Dependencies:** Epic 1.5 (Infrastructure & Resilience)  

## Epic Goal
Establish comprehensive user data lifecycle management enabling seamless multi-device experiences, complete data ownership, and privacy-first synchronization that respects user choice while providing convenient access to tea collections and preferences across all platforms.

## Story 1.6.1: User Account System & Cross-Device Synchronization

**As a** TeaFlow user with multiple devices  
**I want** my tea collection and preferences to sync seamlessly across all my devices  
**So that** I can continue my tea journey on any device without losing my personalized experience

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Account Creation & Authentication**
   - Email-based account creation with verification
   - Social sign-in options (Apple, Google) with privacy protection
   - Guest mode with local data only (no account required)
   - Account linking for users who started without accounts
   - Secure password reset and account recovery

2. **Multi-Device Synchronization**
   ```typescript
   interface SyncableData {
     teaCollection: TeaProfile[];
     brewingHistory: BrewingSession[];
     userPreferences: UserPreferences;
     learningData: LearningProfile;
     customizations: AppCustomizations;
     achievements: UserAchievements;
   }
   
   interface SyncStrategy {
     immediate: string[]; // Critical data synced immediately
     background: string[]; // Non-critical data synced in background
     manual: string[]; // User-initiated sync only
     conflicts: ConflictResolutionStrategy;
   }
   ```

3. **Conflict Resolution System**
   - Automatic merge for non-conflicting changes
   - Last-modified-wins for simple preference updates
   - User choice for complex conflicts (tea modifications, brewing history)
   - Conflict history and audit trail
   - Manual sync trigger for immediate resolution

4. **Device Management**
   - List of linked devices with last sync timestamps
   - Remote device unlinking capability
   - Per-device sync preferences
   - Bandwidth-conscious sync on mobile data
   - Sync scheduling based on device usage patterns

5. **Data Integrity & Security**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Local data verification against cloud checksums
   - Corruption detection and automatic repair
   - Secure token management with automatic refresh
   - Privacy-preserving sync (no personal data in transit metadata)

### Technical Requirements
- Firebase Auth or AWS Cognito for authentication
- Encrypted data storage in cloud (Firebase Firestore or AWS DynamoDB)
- Differential sync to minimize bandwidth usage
- Offline queue for changes made without connectivity
- Background sync scheduling with battery optimization

### Sync Architecture
```typescript
class CloudSyncManager {
  private auth: AuthService;
  private storage: EncryptedCloudStorage;
  private conflictResolver: ConflictResolver;
  
  async syncData(force: boolean = false): Promise<SyncResult> {
    if (!this.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
      return { status: 'no_account', message: 'User not signed in' };
    }
    
    const localData = await this.getLocalData();
    const cloudData = await this.storage.fetchUserData();
    
    if (this.hasConflicts(localData, cloudData)) {
      return this.resolveConflicts(localData, cloudData);
    }
    
    const mergedData = await this.mergeData(localData, cloudData);
    await this.saveData(mergedData);
    
    return { status: 'success', syncedAt: Date.now() };
  }
  
  private async resolveConflicts(
    local: SyncableData, 
    cloud: SyncableData
  ): Promise<SyncResult> {
    const conflicts = this.identifyConflicts(local, cloud);
    
    for (const conflict of conflicts) {
      const resolution = await this.conflictResolver.resolve(conflict);
      await this.applyResolution(conflict, resolution);
    }
    
    return { status: 'conflicts_resolved', conflicts: conflicts.length };
  }
}
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can sign up and sign in across iOS and Android
- [ ] Tea collections sync bidirectionally within 30 seconds
- [ ] Conflicts present clear resolution options to users
- [ ] Offline changes sync automatically when connectivity returns
- [ ] Data remains encrypted in transit and at rest
- [ ] Sync works reliably with 1000+ tea collection entries

    }
  }
  
  private async generatePDFReport(data: ExportData): Promise<ExportResult> {
    return {
      filename: `teaflow-report-${Date.now()}.pdf`,
      size: data.estimatedSize,
      downloadUrl: await this.createSecureDownloadLink(data),
      expiresAt: Date.now() + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
    };
  }
  
  async importData(file: ImportFile): Promise<ImportResult> {
    const validation = await this.validateImportFile(file);
    if (!validation.isValid) {

**Created:** 2025-09-10  
**Product Manager:** John  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** P0 (Foundational Product)  

## Epic Goal

Transform tea brewing from mechanical timing into an anticipatory companion experience through gesture-controlled interactions, living tea metaphor animations, and adaptive learning that knows what users want before they ask.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current State:** Starting from React Native/Expo foundation with basic component structure
- Technology stack: React Native 0.79.5, Expo SDK 53, TypeScript
- Existing components: Basic timer, hourglass animations, theme system
- Integration points: AsyncStorage, gesture handlers, animation libraries already configured

### Enhancement Details

**What's being built:** Complete TeaFlow product implementing BMAD strategic vision
- **Core Innovation:** Gesture-based control on animated tea metaphors (dual-purpose interface)
- **Strategic Differentiation:** First anticipatory tea companion vs reactive timer tools
- **Key Features:** Living animations, OCR scanning, adaptive learning, zen simplicity

**How it integrates:** Builds upon existing React Native foundation while implementing:
- Layered architecture (Gesture → Feedback → Animation → Background)
- Offline-first data persistence with AsyncStorage
- Cross-platform gesture recognition and haptic feedback
- GPU-accelerated Skia animations for living tea metaphors

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete 3+ steeps end-to-end without confusion
- Start brewing in ≤2 taps from app launch
- Timer accuracy ≤0.2s/min drift across devices

## Handoff to Development Team

**Development Team Handoff:**

"This epic represents the complete TeaFlow product vision developed through BMAD strategic analysis. Key implementation considerations:

**Architecture Foundation:**
- Built on proven React Native/Expo stack with existing component patterns
- Layered architecture ensures gesture, animation, and background systems are decoupled
- Offline-first approach prevents service dependencies

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Timer accuracy is non-negotiable - must achieve ≤0.2s/min drift
- Gesture recognition must feel natural and reliable (>95% accuracy)
- Animations must maintain zen quality at 30fps minimum
- Each feature must integrate seamlessly with existing system

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Start with gesture-based timer core (proven foundation)
2. Layer in animations (visual enhancement)
3. Add intelligence features (OCR, learning)
4. Polish user experience and performance

**Integration Points:**
- AsyncStorage for all local data persistence
- react-native-gesture-handler for all touch interactions  
- @shopify/react-native-skia for GPU-accelerated animations
- expo-camera for OCR functionality

The epic maintains system integrity while delivering the world's first anticipatory tea companion."

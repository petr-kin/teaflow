## "Edge taps not registering"
- **Check:** Tapping within 20% of left/right screen edge?
- **Try:** Adjusting sensitivity in Settings
- **Tip:** Look for the subtle edge highlighting

## "Long press too sensitive/not sensitive"
- **Adjust:** Settings → Gesture → Long Press Duration
- **Range:** 0.5 to 2.0 seconds
- **Default:** 1.0 second

## "Accidental double taps"
- **Adjust:** Settings → Gesture → Double Tap Window

- **Alternative:** Disable double tap in Settings

# Advanced Techniques

## **Gesture Chaining**
Combine gestures fluidly:
```
Long press → Tap left edge 3x → Tap center
(Reset → -30s → Start)
```

## **Contextual Gestures**
Same gesture, different meaning:
- **Center tap when idle:** Start timer
- **Center tap when running:** Pause timer
- **Center tap when paused:** Resume timer

*Perfect gestures take practice. Like tea brewing itself, mastery comes through mindful repetition.*
```

## 3. Tea Brewing Basics Template

```markdown
# Tea Brewing Mastery

*Understanding the art and science behind perfect tea*

# The TeaFlow Philosophy

**Great tea isn't about rigid rules—it's about understanding principles, then brewing with intention.**

Every tea is alive. Water temperature, steeping time, and your personal taste create endless possibilities. TeaFlow provides the knowledge; you bring the curiosity.

# The Four Fundamentals

## 1. Temperature: The Foundation

**Why it matters:** Wrong temperature can make tea bitter (too hot) or weak (too cool)

### Quick Reference:
- **Green Tea:** 80°C / 176°F - *Like a warm bath*
- **Black Tea:** 95°C / 203°F - *Just before boiling*  
- **Oolong:** 90°C / 194°F - *Hot shower temperature*
- **White Tea:** 85°C / 185°F - *Warm, not hot*
- **Pu-erh:** 95°C / 203°F - *Full heat for aged leaves*
- **Herbal:** 100°C / 212°F - *Rolling boil*

**TeaFlow handles this:** Each tea preset uses optimal temperature

💡 **Pro tip:** Older teas can handle slightly hotter water

## 2. Time: The Art of Patience

**Why it matters:** Under-steeped tea lacks depth; over-steeped becomes bitter

### Understanding Steep Progression:
**First Steep:** Base flavor, lighter  
**Second Steep:** Fuller flavor, often the best  
**Third Steep:** Subtle changes, nuanced  
**Later Steeps:** Delicate, contemplative

**TeaFlow adapts:** Double-tap advances through optimal timing

⚠️ **Common mistake:** Expecting first steep to be strongest

## 3. Leaf Amount: Quality Over Quantity

**Standard ratios (TeaFlow defaults):**
- **Western style:** 2-3g per 250ml (1 tsp per cup)
- **Gongfu style:** 5-8g per 150ml (stronger, shorter steeps)

**Signs you need more leaves:**
- Tea tastes watery despite long steeping
- Flavors are one-dimensional

**Signs you have too many:**
- Bitter even with short steeps
- Overwhelming astringency

**TeaFlow learns:** Adjusts recommendations based on your strength preferences

## 4. Water: The Silent Partner

**Best water for tea:**
- **Filtered tap water** - Most accessible, good results
- **Spring water** - Ideal mineral content
- **Avoid:** Distilled (too pure), heavily chlorinated

**Quick test:** If your water tastes good plain, it'll make good tea.

# Brewing Styles Explained

## Western Style (TeaFlow Default)
**Approach:** Longer steeps, fewer rounds, convenient  
**Best for:** Daily drinking, beginners, busy schedules  
**Typical:** 2-5 minutes, 1-3 steeps

## Gongfu Style (Advanced)
**Approach:** Many short steeps, mindful experience  
**Best for:** Exploring tea character, meditation, weekends  
**Typical:** 20-60 seconds, 5-10+ steeps

**TeaFlow supports both:** Long press any tea → Choose brewing style

## Grandpa Style (Coming Soon)
**Approach:** Leaves stay in cup, add water as you drink  
**Best for:** Office drinking, travel, simplicity

# Reading Your Tea

## Visual Cues During Brewing:

**Watch the leaves:**
- **Unfurling slowly:** Tea is fresh, gentle brewing
- **Expanding quickly:** Older tea, may need longer steeps
- **Sinking fast:** Well-processed, ready for next steep
- **Floating persistently:** Very fresh or low quality

**Watch the color:**
- **Too light:** Might need more time or hotter water
- **Perfect depth:** Trust the timing
- **Too dark:** Reduce time next round

**TeaFlow's animations reflect these changes** - not just pretty, but informative!

## Taste Evolution:

**First sip:** Initial impression - bright? smooth? harsh?  
**Mid-cup:** Flavors develop as tea cools  
**Last sip:** Aftertaste tells you about quality

**Adjust next time:**
- **Too bitter:** Cooler water or shorter time
- **Too weak:** Hotter water or longer time  
- **Perfect:** Save these settings!

# Advanced Techniques

## Flash Rinse (Gongfu Style)
**Purpose:** "Wake up" compressed or aged teas  
**Method:** Pour hot water, immediately drain  
**When:** Pu-erh, aged oolongs, tightly rolled teas

## Temperature Stepping
**Purpose:** Explore tea's full character  
**Method:** Start cooler, increase temperature each steep  
**When:** High-quality teas, exploration sessions

## Rest Periods
**Purpose:** Let leaves "rest" between steeps  
**Method:** Wait 2-5 minutes between rounds  
**When:** Delicate teas, maximizing steeps

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## "My tea is always bitter"
**Likely causes:** Too hot, too long, too many leaves  
**Try:** Cooler water (drop 10°C), shorter time (-30s)  
**TeaFlow help:** Tap left edge to reduce time

## "My tea tastes like water"
**Likely causes:** Too cool, too short, too few leaves  
**Try:** Hotter water (+5°C), longer time (+30s)  
**TeaFlow help:** Tap right edge to add time

## "Great first cup, terrible second"
**Likely causes:** Over-extracted first steep  
**Try:** Much shorter second steep (30-60s)  
**TeaFlow help:** Double-tap shows optimal next timing

## "Tea gets worse as it cools"
**Likely causes:** Over-extraction, poor quality tea  
**Try:** Shorter steeps, slightly cooler water  
**Consider:** Upgrading your tea quality

# Building Your Palate

## Taste Training Exercises:

### **Week 1:** Single Tea Focus
Choose one tea, brew it 5 different ways:
1. Default TeaFlow settings
2. 30 seconds shorter
3. 30 seconds longer  
4. Cooler water (-10°C)
5. Hotter water (+5°C)

Notice the differences!

### **Week 2:** Tea Comparison
Same settings, different teas:
- Compare green teas from different regions
- Try black tea vs. oolong at same temperature
- Notice how processing affects flavor

### **Week 3:** Multiple Steeps
Focus on one high-quality tea:
- Taste evolution through 5+ steeps
- Note when flavors peak
- Understand why second steep is often best

**TeaFlow tracks your journey:** Brewing history helps you remember preferences

# Seasonal Considerations

## **Spring:** Fresh, delicate teas
- New harvest greens and whites
- Lighter steeps, cooler temperatures
- Focus on subtle flavors

## **Summer:** Refreshing, cooling teas  
- Cold brew preparations
- Lighter teas, shorter steeps
- More frequent brewing

## **Fall:** Rich, warming teas
- Oolongs and aged teas  
- Longer steeps, contemplative sessions
- Exploring depth and complexity  

## **Winter:** Robust, comforting teas
- Dark oolongs, pu-erhs, black teas
- Hotter temperatures, longer sessions
- Hearty, sustaining flavors

# The Mindful Brewing Practice

## Before Brewing:
- **Clear intention:** What do you need from this tea?
- **Present moment:** Set aside distractions
- **Gratitude:** Appreciate the tea's journey to your cup

## During Brewing:
- **Observe:** Watch the TeaFlow animation mindfully

- **Breathe:** Let the aroma center you

## After Brewing:
- **Reflect:** How did this tea serve you?
- **Learn:** What would you adjust next time?
- **Connect:** Share the experience if brewing for others

# Cultural Context

## **Chinese Tradition (Gongfu Cha):**
- Many short steeps
- Small cups, shared experience
- Focus on tea's changing character
- Ceremony as meditation

## **Japanese Way (Chanoyu):**
- Precise movements  
- Seasonal awareness
- Tea as spiritual practice
- Harmony, respect, purity, tranquility

## **British Tradition:**
- Convenience and consistency
- Milk and sugar acceptable
- Social interaction
- Daily comfort ritual

## **Modern Mindfulness:**
- Personal adaptation
- Technology as tool, not master
- Quality over ceremony
- Tea as daily meditation

**TeaFlow honors all traditions** while helping you find your own path.
